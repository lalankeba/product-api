# product-api

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/personal-project-green)

This project is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It provides a simple API for managing product data within an organization. The application supports user authentication through JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensuring secure access to various functionalities based on user roles.

## Features

- **User Registration & Login**: Users can register for an account and log in to access the products.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure access to the API using JSON Web Tokens.
- **Product View**: Any user can view product information. Supports pagination.
- **Admin Privileges**:
  - Create product
  - Update products.
  - Delete products.
- **Token Expiration**: Implemented token expiration for enhanced security.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd product-api`
3. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`
4. Set up environment variables (e.g., Port, MongoDB connection string, JWT secret). Create a `.env` file with following contents.
```
MONGO_URI="<connection-string>"
PORT=<desired-port>
JWT_SECRET=<secret-key>
```
5. Start the server: `npm run dev`

## Post-Installation

1. Register a user through the API.
2. Perform database seeding to assign the ADMIN role to the first user:
   1. Access your MongoDB instance.
   2. Find the newly registered user document in the users collection.
   3. Update the userâ€™s roles array by adding ADMIN.
